    \n# APIs\n\nOpenMetadata supports REST APIs for getting data and in and out of\
    \ the metadata service. APIs are built using general\nbest practices of REST API\
    \ design. We take a schema-first approach by defining Types and Entities in JSON\
    \ Schema. We\nimplement APIs based on these schemas.\n\n## Overview\n\n### URI\n\
    \nFollowing REST API conventions are followed for Resource URIs:\n- Operations\
    \ for an entity are available through the Resource URI as a collection `.../api/<version>/entities`.\
    \ \n- Plural of the entity name is used as the collection name - example `.../api/v1/users`.\n\
    - Trailing forward slash is not used in the endpoint URI. Example use `.../api/v1/databases`\
    \ instead of `.../api/v1/databases/`.\n- Resource URI for an entity instance by\
    \ the entity id is `.../api/v1/entities/{id}`. \n- Resource URI for an entity\
    \ instance by name is `.../api/v1/entities/name/{name}`.\n\n### Resource Representation\n\
    \n- The REST API calls return a response with JSON `Content-Type` and `Content-Length`\
    \ that includes the length of the response.\n- All responses include the Resource\
    \ ID field even though the id was provided in the request to simplify the consumption\
    \ \n  of the response at the client.\n- Entity names and field names use `camelCase`\
    \ per Javascript naming convention.\n- All resources include an attribute `href`\
    \ with Resource URI. All relationship fields of an entity will also \n  include\
    \ `href` links to the related resource for easy access.\n- Unknown fields sent\
    \ by the client in API requests are not ignored to ensure the data sent by the\
    \ client is not dropped \n  at the server without the user being aware of it.\n\
    \n## API Organization\n\nYou can find the swagger documentation [here](/swagger.html).\
    \ In a nutshell:\n\n**Data Asset APIs** - support operations related to data asset\
    \ entities.\n- `.../api/v1/databases`\n- `...api/v1/tables`\n- `.../api/v1/metrics`\n\
    - `.../api/v1/dashboards`\n- `.../api/v1/reports`\n- `.../api/v1/pipelines`\n\
    - `.../api/v1/topics`\n\n**Service APIs** - support operations related to services\
    \ from which metadata is collected:\n- `.../api/v1/services` is the collection\
    \ of all service resources.\n- `.../api/v1/services/databaseService` - APIs related\
    \ to database services. This includes Transactional databases - MySQL, Postgres,\
    \ MSSQL, Oracle, and Data Warehouses - Apache Hive BigQuery, Redshift, and Snowflake.\n\
    - `.../api/v1/services/dashboardService` - APIs related to Dashboard Services.\
    \ This includes Looker, Superset, and Tableau.\n- `.../api/v1/services/messagingService`\
    \ - APIs related to Messaging Services. This includes Apache Kafka, Redpanda,\
    \ - Kinesis, and others.\n\n**Teams & Users APIs**\n- `.../api/v1/teams` - APIs\
    \ related to team entities\n- `.../api/v1/users` - APIs related to user entities\n\
    \n**Search & Suggest APIs** - support search and suggest APIs:\n- `.../api/v1/search`\
    \ - collection for search and suggest APIs\n- `.../api/v1/search/query` - search\
    \ entities using query text\n- `.../api/v1/search/suggest` - get suggested entities\
    \ used for auto-completion\n\n**Other APIs**\n- `.../api/v1/tags` for APIs related\
    \ to Classification and Tag entities\n- `../api/v1/feeds` for APIs related to\
    \ Threads and Posts entities\n- `.../api/v1/usage` for reporting usage information\
    \ of entities"
